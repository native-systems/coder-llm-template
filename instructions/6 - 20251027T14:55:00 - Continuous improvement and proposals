INST-6. Continuous improvement and proposals

INST-6.1. Post-task reflection
INST-6.1.1. After completing, blocking, or abandoning any tracked task, review the effort for notable difficulties, surprises, or inefficiencies encountered during execution.

INST-6.2. Escalating improvement ideas
INST-6.2.1. When reflection identifies a practice or guideline that would have prevented or reduced the difficulty, draft an instruction proposal capturing the recommendation, rationale, and impacted areas.
INST-6.2.2. Store the proposal under `instruction-proposals/` following the standard naming convention, and reference the originating task identifier alongside relevant architecture references.
INST-6.2.3. Escalate the proposal to the user for approval before adoption; once approved, promote it to the canonical instructions directory per INST-2.7.
INST-6.2.4. If the difficulty stems from an existing instruction being unclear or conflicting, note the issue in the task log and include a recommendation to revise that instruction within the proposal.
