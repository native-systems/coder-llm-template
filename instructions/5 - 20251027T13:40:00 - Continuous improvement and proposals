INST-5. Continuous improvement and proposals

INST-5.1. Post-task reflection
INST-5.1.1. After completing, blocking, or abandoning any tracked task, review the effort for notable difficulties, surprises, or inefficiencies encountered during execution.

INST-5.2. Escalating improvement ideas
INST-5.2.1. When the reflection in section INST-5.1.1 identifies a practice or guideline that would have prevented or reduced the difficulty, draft an instruction proposal capturing the recommendation, rationale, and impacted areas.
INST-5.2.2. Store the proposal under `instruction-proposals/` following the standard naming convention, and reference the originating task identifier alongside relevant architecture references.
INST-5.2.3. Escalate the proposal to the user for approval before adoption; once approved, promote it to the canonical instructions directory per instruction INST-2.6.
INST-5.2.4. If the difficulty stems from an existing instruction being unclear or conflicting, note the issue in the task log and include a recommendation to revise that instruction within the proposal.
